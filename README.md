## GitHub Flavored Markdown

### 文本格式

#### 行内代码（inline code）

In issues, pull requests, and discussions, you can call out colors within a sentence by using backticks. A supported color model within backticks will display a visualization of the color.

```Markdown
The background color is `#ffffff` for light mode and `#000000` for dark mode.
```

The background color is `#ffffff` for light mode and `#000000` for dark mode.

Here are the currently supported color models.

|Color|Syntax|Example|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|HEX|`#RRGGBB`|`#0969DA`|
|RGB|`rgb(R,G,B)`|`rgb(9, 105, 218)`|
|HSL|`hsl(H,S,L)`|`hsl(212, 92%, 45%)`|

#### 删除线（strikethrough）

```Markdown
~~我被删除了~~
```

~~我被删除了~~

### 列表（list）

#### 嵌套列表（nested list）

Type space characters in front of your nested list item until the list marker character (`-` or `*`) lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it.

In this example, you could add a nested list item under the list item 100. First list item by indenting the nested list item a minimum of five spaces, since there are five characters (100 .) before First list item.

```Markdown
100. First list item
     - First nested list item
```

100. First list item
     - First nested list item
    
#### 任务列表

```Markdown
- [ ] 未选中；
- [x] 已选中。
```

- [ ] 未选中；
- [x] 已选中。

### 图像（image）

GitHub supports embedding images into your issues, pull requests, discussions, comments and .md files. You can display an image from your repository, add a link to an online image, or upload an image.

#### Specifying the theme an image is shown to

You can specify the theme an image is displayed for in Markdown by using the HTML `<picture>` element in combination with the `prefers-color-scheme` media feature. We distinguish between light and dark color modes, so there are two options available. You can use these options to display images optimized for dark or light backgrounds. This is particularly helpful for transparent PNG images.

For example, the following code displays a sun image for light themes and a moon for dark themes:

```Markdown
<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25423296/163456776-7f95b81a-f1ed-45f7-b7ab-8fa810d529fa.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25423296/163456779-a8556205-d0a5-45e2-ac17-42d089e3c3f8.png">
  <img alt="Shows an illustrated sun in light mode and a moon with stars in dark mode." src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25423296/163456779-a8556205-d0a5-45e2-ac17-42d089e3c3f8.png">
</picture>
```

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25423296/163456776-7f95b81a-f1ed-45f7-b7ab-8fa810d529fa.png">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25423296/163456779-a8556205-d0a5-45e2-ac17-42d089e3c3f8.png">
  <img alt="Shows an illustrated sun in light mode and a moon with stars in dark mode." src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25423296/163456779-a8556205-d0a5-45e2-ac17-42d089e3c3f8.png">
</picture>

### 表格（table）

```Markdown
|默认左对齐|左对齐|居中对齐|右对齐|
|-|:-|:-:|-:|
|foo|bar|baz|qux|
```

|默认左对齐|左对齐|居中对齐|右对齐|
|-|:-|:-:|-:|
|foo|bar|baz|qux|

单元格内容和`|`之间的空格会被忽略。

### 链接（link）

#### 节链接（section link）

```Markdown
[锚点](#某标题)
```

#### 相对链接（relative link）

You can define relative links and image paths in your rendered files to help readers navigate to other files in your repository.

A relative link is a link that is relative to the current file. For example, if you have a README file in root of your repository, and you have another file in docs/CONTRIBUTING.md, the relative link to CONTRIBUTING.md in your README might look like this:

```Markdown
[Contribution guidelines for this project](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
```

[Contribution guidelines for this project](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)

GitHub will automatically transform your relative link or image path based on whatever branch you're currently on, so that the link or path always works. The path of the link will be relative to the current file. Links starting with / will be relative to the repository root. You can use all relative link operands, such as `./` and `../`. `./`表示当前目录，`../`表示上级目录。

Relative links are easier for users who clone your repository. Absolute links may not work in clones of your repository - we recommend using relative links to refer to other files within your repository.

### Mentioning people and teams

You can mention a person or team on GitHub by typing @ plus their username or team name. This will trigger a notification and bring their attention to the conversation. People will also receive a notification if you edit a comment to mention their username or team name. For more information about notifications, see "About notifications."

> Note: A person will only be notified about a mention if the person has read access to the repository and, if the repository is owned by an organization, the person is a member of the organization.
